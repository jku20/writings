<!--tab-->The “Temple Drill,” as it came to be called, was a green and black cordless power drill with one of its drill bits soldered to a jaggedly cut steel can. Pressing the trigger caused the can to rotate, cutting circular holes in what it was held to. After it was sold by a woman from Rhode Island, Terry Hopkins began a fascination with it. He bought it third hand off a sale online and eventually reached out to that original woman from Rhode Island. Annie was her name. They arranged to meet at her “favorite place near the train,” an American restaurant near Providence Station. Annie was short in comparison to Terry. She had well kept black hair contrasting Terry’s long scraggly brown, and sat with authority at a red and white checkered table outside the restaurant. 

> “Hello,” Terry said, sitting down across from her. “I’m Terry Hopkins, nice to meet you.”

> “Yes. Oh, uh, I’m Annie,” she replied. “Nice to meet you.” The two sat for a second before Annie broke the silence asking, “so, where are you coming from.” 

> “Connecticut, a bit away from Hartford,” he said flatly. 

> “So, like the middle-y bit of the state? It nice there?” she said. 

> “Yeah.” The conversation fell quiet for a few more seconds. Annie was the first to speak again saying,

> “Okay, so what do you want to ask me?”

> “You said you lived with Maria one year ago” replied Terry. 

> “Yeah, I did, though I never really got to know her that well. I have to say, it was quite a strange email to get when you asked to meet up.”

> “Oh, I apologize,” Terry said with a bit of surprise.

> “No need, I like talking to interesting people,” Annie replied. “You were going to ask a bit more I presume?”

> “Yes, I guess the first thing is just, can you tell me a little about Maria?” 

> “Well, I moved in with her into what was a little apartment in Rhode Island, like, two years ago? I don’t live there anymore, and well, obviously she doesn’t. She was pleasant enough, a little bit of a gossip sometimes, though, I wasn’t in her circles enough to mind. She spent a lot of time in her room. I don’t know, what else do you want to know? She drank instant coffee half the mornings.” 


<!--tab-->Terry thought for a moment before continuing with, “did you notice anything strange living with her?”
“She had a bit of a crazy head injury one time.” Annie replied, getting a small motion of interest from Terry. “Something must have hit her pretty hard; ate through to the bone. She said it didn’t hurt. Probably a good thing? I went with her to urgent care because she didn’t want to go herself. Really she didn’t want to go at all. We probably waited like five hours before getting to the top of the triage, and all for the doctor to bandage up the hole and say wear hats to cover it up. I mean, she wore hats for the rest of the time I knew her, but that was about the end of it.”
“Did that wound ever heal?” Terry replied.
“I asked her a few times. She always said something like, ‘it’s getting there.’ It was pretty nasty when I saw it, so I‘d buy it didn’t in the maybe two months after.” Annie let out a sigh after finishing the sentence. “You know, I can kind of feel you doing it,” Annie said. “You’re like dancing around the big question; I’m kind of sick of it. I’ll just go ahead and answer it for you: No, I didn’t hollow out her skull with a fucking power drill.”

<!--tab-->Maria was 25 years old when she was found dead by her housemate Annie. At the time, no one knew why she died, only how: she was found in her bed with a circular hole in her temple. Bits of stringy dried skin and flesh bordered the perimeter of the hole coated in a pinkish paste, presumably from the dust and fluid from her skull mixing together. The first responders and doctors who investigated the body believed Maria to be dead for roughly an hour before she was found.

<!--tab-->Terry knew this. He was well acquainted with the Temple Dril before even purchasing it. After purchasing it, he became the foremost fanatic of the device. He had called two friends, people who wouldn’t laugh at him, to his garage to run a series of “experiments” he had devised. One involved a marble sheet, which a long haired boy was stumbling over to two cinder blocks laid side by side. He placed it down giving a thumbs up and crouched down to hold the sheet. A tall girl with long hair, dyed with streaks of red, held the Temple Drill above the marble and asked Terry, who was standing next to her, “you got the Camera?”

> “Yep!,” he said, then looking at the long haired boy checked, “Lance, you’ve got a good enough grip.” 

> “Shut up, I can hold it,” Lance replied.

> Terry then looked at the girl next to him again and asked, “Lisel, are you also ready?” She rolled her eyes at him. “Okay, try the drill” yelled Terry as he started filming. Lisel pulled the trigger and the metal began to glance off of the marble, leaving only a few small scratches. Lisel pushed the drill down harder on the sheet, but doing so put only enough resistance on the drill to stop it turning.

> “No luck,” she said. “I’m going to stop before I break the, what did you call it?” she said, stifling a laugh looking at Lance, “the Temple Drill?”

> “Yeah, I didn’t think that’d go through marble either,” remarked Terry. “Well, worth a try. Seems like the Temple Drill is just for wood and bone. Let’s try the deer skull next.”

> “Cool” Lance said as he jumped up and ran to the cardboard box in the corner of the garage. For a moment, Terry and Lisel sat and watched Lance's excitement as he rummaged through the box and came back to put the skull on the cinder blocks. 

> “Okay again, everyone get ready!” Terry said. He started recording the camera, “Ready”; Lisel picked back up the drill, “Ready!”; Lance crouched down to hold the skull, “Ready.” Lisel pressed the trigger to hear a quiet whine as bits of white dust started falling from the side of the skull as the drill outlined a circle. For about five minutes, everyone was silent listening to the drill, until the circle of bone from the skull hit the ground with a clack. 

> “Didn’t expect that,” Lisel said, “I always thought bones were harder than that.” 

> “Well how do you think Maria got such a strange injury,” retorted Terry as he stopped the camera. “This drill was made perfectly to eat through bones.” 

> “Yeah, I guess you're right,” Lisel replied. “So, satisfied with what this drill is for: some weird trepanning device?”

> “That doesn’t feel much like a satisfying answer,” Terry said. 

> “Doesn’t have to be,” said Lisel, “some people are just crazy.” With arguments like that, the two went back and forth for nearly an hour. Eventually Lisel parrotted, as she often does, the opinion of the state. “Maria is a wakeup call to the mental health crises in America. We must do better for our people and for Maria!” 

This slogan was run by a senator the previous year. That year he got elected. When Maria died, the news cycle quickly picked up the case, crowds travelling from all over to Rhode Island to Annie’s yard sale to buy things which Maria may have interacted with. Terry was one of these people: he bought the Temple Drill. 


<!--tab-->After Annie’s outburst at him, he tried to be more friendly with her. The food came quickly, giving Terry a valid excuse not to talk. They both finished their burgers and Terry tentatively said, “Thanks for telling me everything Annie, it helps me a lot.” 

> “Helps with what?” Annie quipped with her neutral expression turning to a frow. “Why are you so interested in this power drill anyway?”

> I guess, I bought the drill,” Terry replied. “We’ve been calling it the Temple Drill, and haven’t really known what to do with it. It, uh, works surprisingly well at what it was designed for: making holes. It’s just, it feels like there has to be some bigger reason for such an effective machine to be made for such a strange task.” This made Annie only frown more. 

> “Looking for some bigger reason for why some crazy person thought it was a good idea to figure out how to hijack a power drill to slowly eat through her skull? Frankly, I think that search is a little gross. That and everyone keeping it at the top of their minds.” 

<!--tab-->Annie got up, leaving twenty dollars on the restaurant table and walked to her car in the parking lot. She drove east. In half an hour she arrived at Rehoboth Historic Cemetery where she sat alone on the grass, surrounded by people hundreds of years dead, and dug her hands into the dirt, picking grass, and making friendship bracelets. Terry left for his hotel, and then in the next month figured out how to buy mice, storing them in his garage.

<!--tab-->Terry used the temple drill on five of the mice. It was designed for larger creatures, but still it was just small enough to fit on the top of the mices’ heads. The first mouse feared the noise of the drill and ran free through a crack in the garage walls. The second mouse, Terry had to hold down to stop it from running after recoiling at the touch of the drill. After a minute, this second mouse’s fur was wet with blood, and the flesh on the mouse’s head had parted to show a scratched skull. The mouse had stopped attempting to escape, but instead laid under the rotating drill bit with its eyes open. After five minutes, the drill felt less resistant and Terry stopped it. With a small squelch, it and a piece of the mouse’s skull was removed. The mouse’s brain had been visibly scratched by the drill, but the mouse continued to live for the next fifteen minutes. The three other mice tested behaved similarly. Terry came to the conclusion only a larger skull could support the Temple Drill’s hole. He then disappeared from his house. 

> “Did you ever get back in touch with Terry?” asked Lance sitting down at a red and white checkered table outside a restaurant. 

> “Nope,” responded Lisel, taking the seat next to him. “It’s probably for the best. I didn’t really want any more to do with him or that thing.” 

> “So you decided to come all the way up to a restaurant in Rhode Island to talk to the progenitor of this entire ordeal,” said Lance sarcastically.

> “And I found it fitting for you to come along,” said Lisel flatly. “Annie said this was her favorite restaurant, so hopefully it'll be worth the trip for the food alone.” At that moment, a woman with slightly less than shoulder length hair approached the pair, asking “are you Lisel, and you, uh, Lance?”

> “Yes,” they both replied. 

> “Sorry to keep you waiting, got caught in traffic,” the Woman said. “Oh, I’m Annie by the way.”

> “We’re surprised you came at all,” blurted Lance. 

> Annie responded with a smile, saying “I always like talking to interesting people.” She then took the seat across from Annie. 

> “So, you lived with Maria when she died?” Lisel asked, “I’m sorry about that.”

> “No need, it was a long enough time ago. So Lisel, and Lance, you are here like everyone else to talk about the drill?”

> “No, I didn’t…” Lisel started before Lance interrupted with a louder “No!”

> “Yeah, it’s about, uh, do you remember a couple months ago talking to a guy named Terry?” Lance asked.

> “What about him?” said Annie coldly.

> “We’re just kind of curious what you told him,” said Lisel. “He got obsessed with the drill after talking to you.”

> “Huh, I don’t know, he seemed pretty obsessed already when I’d met him,” said Annie before pausing to take a deep breath. “I probably snapped a bit at him. I think that was still when a bunch of news people were asking for stories.” 

> “What, that it?” Lance replied. 

> “I don’t know, maybe I threw in some black humor joke near the end about trying the drill myself,” said Annie. 

<!--tab-->She hadn’t made that joke, but everyone accepted the lie. The three then continued to talk, mostly not about Terry. They got along well. After the meal, they said their partings and Lisel and Lance went directly back to the train station and eventually their houses. Getting home, they each found a handwritten note in their doorways. It was signed “Terry Hopkins.” 


<!--tab-->“I’m going to attempt the Temple Drill on myself,” read the letter. “The mice had this look of peacefulness, content on their faces. I tied them down and cut open their skulls with a tool far too bulky for their small heads and then pushed too hard and scrambled their brains. Yet, they were happy. Maria drilled her own head and then was found a day later in her bed. I bet she too died happy, a feeling of euphoria pulsing through her head as it exposed itself to the world. Why else would she pick away the flesh of her face? It was probably like the feeling of scratching an itch, that simultaneous pain and satisfaction scratching away dirt and skin and seeing it take off into the air. Everyone gets the feeling of an itchy temple. Maria wasn’t crazy, she simply acted on that itchy feeling as we all should. She is the only sane one of us. She made the Temple Drill for us. She died making it for us. It’s an obligation by her dead blood and bone to learn about Mara; how to use the Temple Drill; how to make more; how to spread it to others. But I don’t know if any other devices like this could be made. Not something so precise in how it treats carefully pulverizing the bone and skin. It’s ironic with the Temple Drill’s amateurish look. It’s wrong to say looking at its crass edges I have no fear in using the drill on myself, for any new invention comes with fear. Yet it’s with this fear comes excitement and purpose, a desire so intense to erase any prohibitions on the invention’s use.”

<!--tab-->Terry Hopkins was found dead, collapsed near a power drill with a circular hole cut into his skull. The death has been ruled an accident by first responders.
